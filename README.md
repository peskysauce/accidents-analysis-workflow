# US Accidents analysis workflow

Us accidents data downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

In this dataset I'm trying to identify:
- What are the main causes of accidents in the US
- Which state and cities has the highest number of accidents and why.
- What hours of the day are accidents most likely to happen.
- What action can the authority take to bring accident rates down?

This project aims to refresh and sharpen my analytics skills further, a continuation of my EDA project. Including building upon my pandas, matplotlib, regular expressions, slicing data, using different libraries to fill in empty datapoints, extracting descriptive texts into distinct categories and more. It serves to solidify the data analysis work flow.

The dataset downloaded was cleaned and manipulated to make the analysis more steamlined, further details can be found in the ipynb.

P.S Due to the size of dataset it cannot be commited to github, one can access the dataset from the Kaggle link above and import the data to jupyter.
